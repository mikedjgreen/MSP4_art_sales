#### 1 As a visitor to the site I would like to view art works for sale
    If I see something I like, I would like to know the price, what it's made of and size of it ( will it 'fit' on my wall or shelf ), as well as it's title and who made it.

#### 2 As a patron I would like to buy artworks within my price range and likes

#### 3 As a frequent patron I would like to keep a record of my purchases with the club

#### 4 As a patron I would like to keep a running total of incomplete orders,
            including V.A.T.,
            delivery charges (if not collecting)
            and potential commission to the club.
